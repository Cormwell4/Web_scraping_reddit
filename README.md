Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment trends in news articles and Reddit discussions related to avian influenza (bird flu). The goal is to extract, analyze, and interpret text data using sentiment analysis to gauge the overall tone of media and public discourse surrounding the topic.

The project consists of two major components:

News Article Sentiment Analysis – Fetches news articles from NewsAPI, processes their text, and performs sentiment analysis using TextBlob.
Reddit Discussion Scraper – Extracts Reddit posts and comments containing relevant keywords, then stores them for further analysis.
